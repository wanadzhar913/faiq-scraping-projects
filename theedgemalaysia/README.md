# Note
The **"language" column for the data set has errors** as it miscategorizes articles in the Mandarin language. This is primarily because I was searching for the string "English version" in the text. This will need to be accounted for if type of language used is important. 

# Methodology

For [The Edge Malaysia](https://theedgemalaysia.com/), each of their articles seem to have a unique ID at the end of the url e.g., "677590" in "https://theedgemalaysia.com/node/677590". Hence, since we won't be able to do this by month, page no., etc., we'll use a **brute force** approach that tests every combination of numbers, such that we'll only scrape from a valid url.
